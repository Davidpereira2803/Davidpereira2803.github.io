      "description": "An innovative project integrating facial emotion recognition with a DJI Tello drone. Temo interprets human facial expressions to control drone behavior, creating an interactive and responsive aerial experience. Using the ROS2 Tello wrapper developed by the SNT-ARG Team from the University of Luxembourg. The project is currently beeing developed and implements a handfull of new modules and features, such as full control with a PS4 controller, full control using the smartphone IMU sensors, full control using an ESP32 paired with a MCP9250 module, and a module that allows the user to play a target shooter game from the drones perspective using ArUco markers as targets.",
